### Bachelors thesis: Software development and virtual reality. ###
ObjectScape is the result of my bachelors project. The goal was to help students learn object oriented programming.

It's a Escape Room virtual reality education game, where players solve puzzles and code real (virtual) objects that they have to use to solve them.

Made with Unity for HTC Vive.
