### Bachelors thesis: Software development and virtual reality. ###
ObjectScape is the result of my bachelors project. It is a video game set in virtual reality. 
Goal of this project is to teach players principles of object oriented programming.

If you want to learn mor, you can read my thesis's anotation below.

#### Anotation: ####
During software development, programmers usually manipulate source code with a keyboard and a mouse and then view this code through one or more 2D monitors. These traditional ways of software development ignore new opportunities provided by technologies that display virtual reality, such as many possibilities of visualization in 3D space and utilization of natural human abilities that can  interact with this space. 

However, traditional programming in virtual reality is impractical, so we need to devise a different stance to take. To translate functionality of real world programming language into virtual reality is a non trivial task. What we could do is create a limited set of functions to use within virtual reality. 

We chose to take the object oriented approach to create this set. This micro world would be sufficient for educational purposes. We use HTC Vive to interact with the micro world, because it allows us to move freely within the virtual 3D space and  manipulate the objects in it. This micro world has the likeness of a video game, so the user would enjoy using it and so they would be motivated to learn rules of the game world -- to learn object oriented thinking.
