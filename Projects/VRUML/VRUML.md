### Masters thesis: Application of natural interaction methods for virtual reality, within the context of UML modeling ###
In software development, UML diagrams are often used to communicate abstract
system structures. Traditional software modeling is done using a paper or a monitor,
mouse and keyboard, and the possibilities provided by new technologies in virtual
reality and new, innovative, natural ways of human-computer interaction are not
utilized. Traditional UML modeling has several limitations concerning the amount
of information that we can view at once, preserving the diagram’s readability. A
way to combat these limitations are 3D UML diagrams, which enable us to encode
more visual information, use more space and create more complex spatial structures.
Previous works that studied 3D UML have concluded that utilizing 3D space eases
user’s cognitive burden, and that diagrams made from 3D objects are easier to interpret and remember. However, the recurring problem is the increase of interaction
and navigation complexity using traditional 2D approaches. The solution is to adapt
3D UML to virtual reality, with the emphasis on discovering the most appropriate
interaction model, using new interaction technologies for virtual reality. In this thesis, we will evaluate and compare different approaches to conducting interactions
and text input in virtual reality, within the context of modeling UML class diagrams,
in order to evaluate user experience with these approaches and thus increase the
efficiency of UML modeling in virtual reality.

The VRUML environment was made with Unity for HTC Vive, Samsung Oddysey and Leap Motion.
