#### Short bio: ####
Hello, my name is Kristina. I am studying Computer Science in [FIIT STU](https://www.fiit.stuba.sk) in Bratislava.
I have experience in web development, and I have an avid interest in video games, both playing them but also making them.

I have an aspiration in video game design and development, and I do have some [projects](/projects) that I am working on.

My other interests include appreciating the fine arts of cinema and literature, especially those
of the sci-fi and fantasy genre, and manual crafts, such as sewing.
