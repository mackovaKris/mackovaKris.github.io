I am a student of [Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies at the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava](https://www.fiit.stuba.sk). 

I have an aspiration in video game design and development. I am currently specializing in Virtual reality.

My other interests include books, video games and board games. I also partake in creative hobbies, like manual crafts.
